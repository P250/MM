# Template for CS2 Metamod plugins with windows & linux build support.
Thank you to GAMMACASE for updating the s2 sample plugin and CS2Fixes for the relevant docker files :)

## Compiling for Linux
Simply run `docker compose up` in the project directory. Note that you must have the hl2sdk (cs2 branch) in your project, specifically named `hl2sdk-cs2`, as well as your `hl2sdk-manfiests` named folder in the project directory. I use git submodules for this.
